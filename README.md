# taptogo-style-guide

This repository provides a simple style guide inspired by the [taptogo.net](https://www.taptogo.net) website. It demonstrates navigation, buttons, forms, toggles, accordions, tables, typography, and color palette approximations using TAP's brand colors.

## Style Guide

Open [`style-guide.html`](style-guide.html) to view the style guide page. It references locally stored assets in the `assets/` directory to apply TAP-like styles.

## Notes

External TAP resources were unreachable from this environment, so the included CSS and JavaScript in `assets/` are approximations based on known brand colors and component structures.
